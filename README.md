### ✨Hiya! Maxine here!✨

 I'm a Pipeline TD & 3D Character Artist from the Netherlands.
 Currently I am focusing on learning C++ & Python for VFX pipeline development.
 In my free time I like to work on 3D art, graphics code, DCC scripts and making silly games!
 My aim is to better learn the technology used in VFX/Games and apply my mix of artistic and technical skills as a TD in production, and to develop 3D art & production tools for others to use!
