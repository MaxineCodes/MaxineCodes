I'm a Pipeline TD from the Netherlands.  
I am focused mostly on C++ & Python for animation/film pipeline development.
In my free time I like to work on 3D art, graphics coding, DCC scripts and making silly games!
My aim is to better learn the technology used in VFX/Games and apply my mix of artistic and technical skills as a TD in production, and to develop 3D art & production tools for others to use!
